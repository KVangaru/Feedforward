The Feedforward Algorithm is a fundamental concept in artificial neural networks (ANNs). It is used to process input data through a network of layers to generate an output. This algorithm is the backbone of deep learning models and is commonly used in tasks such as image recognition, natural language processing, and classification.

How It Works

The feedforward process involves the following steps:

Input Layer: The input data is provided to the neural network.

Weights and Biases: Each connection between neurons has an associated weight and bias.

Hidden Layers: The data passes through one or more hidden layers where computations occur.

Activation Functions: Activation functions like ReLU, Sigmoid, or Tanh introduce non-linearity to the network.

Output Layer: The processed data produces a final output, such as a classification label or a predicted value.
